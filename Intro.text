The Smart Classroom Automation project leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to automate various classroom functions, improving convenience and control. The system uses basic IoT components, including the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, which acts as the core microcontroller to enable communication between various devices in the classroom and the internet.

Features:
Web and Mobile Control:

The system is controlled via a web dashboard and a mobile application, allowing users (teachers or administrators) to manage classroom equipment such as lights, fans, projectors, and more remotely.
The mobile app was created using Blynk, a popular IoT platform that provides an intuitive interface for controlling IoT devices from anywhere.
ESP8266 Module:

The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with full TCP/IP stack, enabling easy connectivity of devices to the internet. It connects sensors (like temperature and light sensors) and devices (like lights, fans) to the IoT network.
Sensors Integration:

Various sensors like motion detectors, temperature sensors, and light sensors are integrated to automate the classroom environment.
For example, the lights and fans can be automatically turned on/off based on the room's occupancy or temperature levels.
Energy Efficiency:

The system promotes energy efficiency by controlling devices based on real-time data. For instance, if the room is empty, lights and fans can be automatically turned off to save energy.
Data Monitoring:

The web dashboard and mobile app display real-time data from sensors (such as temperature, humidity, and light levels), allowing teachers to monitor the classroom environment. It also allows them to adjust settings such as lighting or fan speed.
User-Friendly Interface:

The web dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and accessible on multiple devices (PCs, tablets, etc.), enabling easy monitoring and control of classroom automation.
Benefits:

Improved classroom management, comfort, and convenience.
Energy-saving by automating the control of electronic devices.
Enhanced user experience through mobile control.
Technologies Used:
IoT Components:
ESP8266: Used for Wi-Fi connectivity to connect IoT devices to the internet.
Blynk: A mobile app and web dashboard platform for creating custom user interfaces to control IoT devices.
Various Sensors: Motion, temperature, and light sensors for environmental monitoring and automation.
Web and Mobile Development:
Blynk App: For controlling devices via smartphones.
Web Dashboard: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-time monitoring.
This smart classroom system not only simplifies classroom management but also brings efficiency and energy savings, making it an essential application of IoT in education.
